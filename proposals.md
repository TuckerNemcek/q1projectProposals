Proposals for q1 project

Proposal 1

BeBetter

A website for following through on goals. The user picks out a goal such as

A. I want to get in better shape.

B. I want more fun hobbies

C. I want to get a boy/girlfriend

The app then picks a random goal to assign to that user. The goals are SMART goals

Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Relevant
Time bound

The app then gives that goal to the user with a time limit. Users can re-roll if they want to chicken out, or just see a list of goals. The idea is that the website is set on your homepage. The website will allow users to log in using local storage. For instance, if I pick fitness, and the app sets a goal of 350 pushups a day for me, when I log on it will say

Hey Tucker how are those pushups coming along?

 There is then a box underneath where I can enter a number. if I enter 50 it will say

 Nice job! only 300 left to go!

 If you pick hobbies it could give you a simple "Go to three places you are interested in and take a tour" goal. There is an unlimited amount of goals you can add. I may make it a fitness app for starters and then add more for stretch goals.

 Another stretch goal is to add other things to make the website a complete homepage so that people actually use it. Maybe add a weather app and check stocks, add other nice features.



Option 2

Make a portfolio like Ben's page. May not be as fun as the other one, but it is definitely practical. I would like to be able to add other projects to it easily as well as have it be styled really well. Anyone can point to their gitHub (and this site will as well), but it would really allow me to flex as a developer if I can point potential employers to something I coded from scratch. I will give concise descriptions of my projects as well as previews. I don't really know how to add client side validation or Local Storage to it as I don't want potential employers to have to make a password before viewing my portfolio.
